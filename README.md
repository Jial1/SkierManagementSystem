## Backend for the Skier Management System

### Run the program 
To run the client, you need to update the IP address in the top String url of the skierClient class with your own address. For example, a valid URL would look like this: http://54.200.34.34:8080/SkierServer_war/skiers/9/seasons/2024/days/1/skiers/12. (You would need to change 54.200.34.34 with your address)
Also, you would need to change the host, username, and password to your rabbitmq in the RMQChannelPool class and Recv class
